# Central College Vendor Templates

The following templates are available for use by approved vendors on behalf of Central College.

## Dependencies
The only outside dependency for these vendor templates is the [Font Aweosome](http://fontawesome.io/) font library. You can install this dependency using [Bower](https://bower.io).

## One Column Template
The one column template folder includes minified and unminified CSS, minified and unminified JavaScript and an index.html file. To use this template, only the `index.html` and the `main.min.css` files are required. The JavaScript is included at the base of the index.html file to minimize http requests.
